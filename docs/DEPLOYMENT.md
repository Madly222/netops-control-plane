# Deployment Guide

How to run NetOps Control Plane in production on a Linux host with systemd.
For configuration details see [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md).

This guide assumes the project lives at `/home/user/netops-control-plane` and
runs as the `user` account. Adjust paths/usernames to your environment — the
shipped unit files in `scripts/` use exactly these values.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

```bash
# System packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv openssh-client snmp mysql-client

# Project + virtualenv
cd /home/user/netops-control-plane
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

| Package | Required for |
|---------|--------------|
| `openssh-client` | all SSH operations |
| `snmp` (`snmpwalk`) | ONU/GPON monitoring |
| `mysql-client` | DHCP→NetBox MAC sync DB queries |

---

## 2. Configuration

```bash
cp secrets.example.yaml secrets.yaml
cp .env.example .env
nano secrets.yaml          # servers, Claude key, web users, OLTs
nano .env                  # only if using automation modules

# SSH keys for key-auth servers
mkdir -p keys
cp /path/to/server.key keys/
chmod 600 keys/*
```

Before going live:
- Change all default passwords in `web_users` (at least 10 characters).
- Behind HTTPS, set `mcp_server.cookie_secure: true` (see [Hardening](#7-hardening)).

Smoke-test before installing the service:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m src.main          # Ctrl-C after it reports "Starting web server..."
```

---

## 2a. Docker

`Dockerfile` builds a slim image (Python 3.12, `snmp`, `openssh-client`) that runs
as uid 1000 and keeps its runtime data (users, sessions, settings, audit log,
caches) in the `/data` volume. `docker-compose.yml` has two services:

- `demo` (default): `docker compose up` runs the app with `DEMO_MODE=1` against
  simulated servers and OLTs. Nothing outside the container is contacted.
- `monitor` (profile `prod`): your configuration. The superadmin console edits
  `.env` and the power-outage address list, so both are mounted writable and must
  exist before the first start:

```bash
touch .env
cp -n config/electric_addresses.example.txt config/electric_addresses.txt
docker compose --profile prod up -d monitor
docker compose logs -f monitor
```

`secrets.yaml` and `keys/` are mounted read-only. Put a reverse proxy with TLS in
front and set `mcp_server.cookie_secure: true` (see [Hardening](#7-hardening)).
The DHCP→NetBox MAC sync needs `mysql-client`, which the image leaves out; add it
to the `apt-get install` line if you use that job.

## 3. Main service (web app)

Create the unit:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/mcp-monitor.service
[Unit]
Description=NetOps Control Plane
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=user
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/netops-control-plane
Environment="PATH=/home/user/netops-control-plane/venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
ExecStart=/home/user/netops-control-plane/venv/bin/python -m src.main
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
TimeoutStopSec=10
KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now mcp-monitor
sudo systemctl status mcp-monitor
```

The dashboard is then available at `http://<host>:4455`.

---

## 4. Scheduled automation (timers)

The `scripts/` directory ships ready-made one-shot `.service` units and matching
`.timer` units. Install whichever jobs you use.

| Job | Service unit | Timer | Default schedule | Runs |
|-----|--------------|-------|------------------|------|
| Water outage | `acc-monitor.service` | `acc-monitor.timer` | daily 08:00 | `scripts/acc_monitor.py` |
| Electricity outage | `electric-monitor.service` | `electric-monitor.timer` | daily 09:00 | `scripts/check_electric.py` |

Install (example for both):

```bash
sudo cp scripts/acc-monitor.service scripts/acc-monitor.timer \
        scripts/electric-monitor.service scripts/electric-monitor.timer \
        /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now acc-monitor.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now electric-monitor.timer

# Verify schedule
systemctl list-timers 'acc-monitor*' 'electric-monitor*'

# Trigger one run immediately to test
sudo systemctl start electric-monitor.service
journalctl -u electric-monitor.service -n 50 --no-pager
```

> The one-shot units are `Type=oneshot`: they run, log, and exit. The timer with
> `Persistent=true` will catch up a missed run after downtime.


## 5. Logs & operations

```bash
# Web service logs (systemd + loguru file)
journalctl -u mcp-monitor -f
tail -f /home/user/netops-control-plane/logs/app.log

# Timer job logs
journalctl -u acc-monitor.service
journalctl -u electric-monitor.service

# Restart after config change
sudo systemctl restart mcp-monitor
```

Application logs rotate automatically (size-based, zipped) per
`config/settings.yaml > logging.rotation`.

---

## 6. Updating

```bash
cd /home/user/netops-control-plane
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt        # in case deps changed
sudo systemctl restart mcp-monitor
```

If timer unit files changed, re-copy them and `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

---

## 7. Hardening

- **Reverse proxy + TLS.** Put nginx/Caddy in front and terminate HTTPS; don't
  expose `:4455` directly.
- **Secure cookie.** Behind HTTPS set `mcp_server.cookie_secure: true`.
- **CORS.** Off by default; add origins to `mcp_server.cors_origins` only if
  another site must call the API.
- **Firewall.** Limit `:4455` to trusted networks.
- **Secrets.** `secrets.yaml`, `.env`, and `keys/` are gitignored — keep file
  permissions tight (`chmod 600` on keys; restrict the project dir).
- **SSH keys instead of passwords.** Put a key in `keys/` and use
  `auth_type: key` with `auth_value: monitor` (the file name in `keys/`), so
  `secrets.yaml` holds no server passwords:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f keys/monitor -N ""
  ssh-copy-id -i keys/monitor.pub monitor@192.0.2.10
  ```
- **Least privilege.** Run the panel's SSH sessions as a dedicated `monitor` user
  with key-only login. To avoid storing a `sudo_password`, give that user
  `NOPASSWD` sudo. Be aware that the panel wraps every elevated command as
  `sudo env PATH=... sh -c '<command>'` (so that pipes and `||` fallbacks run
  elevated too), and sudoers wildcards match `;`, so sudo cannot be narrowed to
  "only restarts" with patterns: whoever holds the monitor key has root on that
  server. What limits the damage is the panel itself (roles, the risk policy,
  confirmations and the audit log) and keeping `keys/` readable by the service
  user only.
- **Host keys.** With `mcp_server.ssh_host_keys: tofu` (the default) each server's
  key is saved on the first connection and checked afterwards. After reinstalling a
  server, delete its line from `sessions/known_hosts`.
- **File permissions.** The app writes `.env`, `sessions/users.json`,
  `sessions/runtime_settings.json`, `sessions/web_sessions.json` and
  `sessions/known_hosts` as owner-only (0600). Do the same for `secrets.yaml` and
  `keys/*` (`chmod 600`), and run the service as its own user.
- **Sessions.** Delete `sessions/web_sessions.json` and restart to log everyone out.
